The Chief Executive Officer of the organization wants me to prepare a data analytics report on the latest ratings for each employee in each department across the organization and their respective manager relative to the salary received by the employee. To achieve this, a dataset provided that includes information on the Salaries and Ratings of each employee in all the departments and their respective Manager will be used. The objective is to use data analytics methods to analyze this dataset to gain insights and establish possible relationships that may exist among the variables. Thus, ensuring the organization makes strategic and informed decisions on issues relating to Ratings and Salaries of employees and managers to improve its overall growth and productivity.
